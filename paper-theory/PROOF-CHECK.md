# Independent proof-check ledger — theory companion paper

**Issue:** WOV-277 (T4-4), **Step 1 only**: *Independent proof-check of every
theorem / lemma / proposition (each assumption used, each step justified);
verify all idealization disclosures are attached.*

This ledger records **step 1 only**. Steps 2 (notation / cross-reference /
figure consistency) and 3 (arXiv packaging) were performed subsequently in the
same issue; their outcome is recorded in [`ARXIV.md`](ARXIV.md) and the README
status, not here.

**Method.** Each formal result was re-derived from its stated hypotheses
without trusting the surrounding prose: every invoked lemma was checked to be
actually applicable, every "by X" was confirmed to discharge the step it
claims, and the hypothesis each result *needs* was compared against the one it
*states* (and against the parity-ledger `tab:parity-ledger`). Numerical claims
were recomputed in Python. The manuscript was rebuilt with `tectonic`; all
cross-references and citations resolve (no `undefined`/`??`).

**Verdict.** All 60 formal environments + 5 predictions are sound as stated.
**Four findings were applied as fixes** (§1): one genuine defect
(`prop:abs-strict`) and three proof-hygiene corrections surfaced by the
re-verification (a G3 disclosure gap in §3, a missing hypothesis in
`cor:defect-two-term`, a mis-cited equation in the `thm:defect-risk-gap` proof).
The idealization-disclosure guardrail (G3) is satisfied.

## 1. Findings applied as fixes

### 1.1 `prop:abs-strict` (§4, "Absolute parity is strictly stronger") — converse witness *(genuine defect)*

**Problem.** The converse direction constructed the witness as
`rep' = (rep, N)` where `N ⊥ (X,Y)` is "independent noise." A representation is
a *deterministic* measurable map of `X` (`def:rep`); a function of `X` that is
independent of `X` is a.s. constant, so such an `N` forces
`σ(rep') = σ(rep)` — contradicting the very `σ(rep') ⊋ σ(rep)` the witness is
meant to exhibit. The step "rep' retains every predictive bit … yet
σ(rep') ⊋ σ(rep)" was therefore not justified by the construction given.

**Fix (committed).** Replaced the adjoined-noise construction with a rigorous
one that draws the extra coordinate from *within* `X`: take `rep` sufficient and
adjoin a coordinate `N` of the input that is not `σ(rep)`-measurable (a
predictively inert / surface-byte feature). Then `rep'` refines `rep`
(`σ(rep) ⊆ σ(rep') ⊆ B(X)`), and `cor:dpi-rep` along the refinement squeezes
`I(Y;rep'(X))` between `I(Y;rep(X))` and `I(Y;X)`, which sufficiency of `rep`
collapses to equality — so `rep'` is sufficient (`rep ≡_par rep'`) while
`σ(rep') ⊋ σ(rep)`. A parenthetical now records explicitly why independent
noise cannot serve. The result statement is unchanged and was already
independently witnessed by the C-ladder (`C1⁺` vs `C4`) and by
`prop:decode-parity`(c); the fix only repairs the illustrative proof step.

**Impact on downstream results: none.** Nothing depends on the *method* of the
witness, only on the truth of `prop:abs-strict`, which is unchanged.
`thm:retraction`(iii), `cor:defect-finer-order`, `rem:which-parity`, and
`tab:cladder` all cite the statement, not the construction.

### 1.2 `thm:retraction` (§3) — missing G3 idealization disclosure

**Problem.** Part (iii) invokes `thm:irrelevance` (for `R*(A)=R*(B)`) in the
theorem statement, yet §3 carried *no* `\idealization{…}` at all — it relied
solely on the disclosure in the appendix proof. Every other theorem that
consumes the at-optimum result (`thm:bounded-gap` §5, `thm:defect-risk-gap` §6)
carries the disclosure both at the statement and in the proof; §3 was the lone
gap. Under Step 1's mandate to "verify all idealization disclosures are
attached," the statement-site disclosure was missing.

**Fix.** Added a concise `\idealization{…}` inside the `thm:retraction` block:
parts (i)–(ii) are purely categorical (no idealization); part (iii) inherits
Bayes-optimality and exact operational parity via `thm:irrelevance`, and claims
only at-optimum invisibility, not empirical zero. Matches the §5/§6 pattern.
G3 disclosure count is now **18** and every section that invokes the irrelevance
theorem carries a co-located disclosure.

### 1.3 `cor:defect-two-term` (§6) — unstated joint hypothesis

**Problem.** The corollary "takes the smaller" of `eq:defect-risk-gap` (requires
an `L`-Lipschitz loss) and `eq:defect-fisher-local` (requires a bounded loss),
so it needs the loss to be *both*. The statement only hinted at this through
`c=c(L,‖ℓ‖∞,λ)`; the hypothesis was not stated, so "both bounds apply" was
asserted without its premise.

**Fix.** Added the explicit hypothesis "the loss is both `L`-Lipschitz and
bounded, so both bounds apply" to the corollary. (Result and constant unchanged;
on a bounded action space Lipschitz already implies bounded, so this only makes
the premise explicit.)

### 1.4 `thm:defect-risk-gap` proof (appendix) — mis-cited equation

**Problem.** The proof expanded the swap gap "through the risk functional
`eq:risk-as-posterior`'s defining expectation." But `eq:risk-as-posterior` is
the **Bayes**-risk identity `R*(rep)=E[G(q_rep)]` (the optimal posterior),
whereas here `K` is an *arbitrary fixed* bounded predictor. The relevant object
is `def:risk`. The mis-citation also quietly undercut the proof's own claim that
no Bayes-optimality is used.

**Fix.** Replaced the reference with `def:risk` and added a parenthetical that
this is the risk of the arbitrary kernel `K`, not the Bayes risk, so no
optimality is invoked. The computation itself was already correct and is
unchanged.

### §4 Information parity & irrelevance
| Result | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `def:entropy/kl/mi`, chain rule | ✓ | |
| `lem:dpi` DPI | ✓ | two-order chain-rule expansion; equality case correct |

| `prop:suff-iff-mi` | ✓ | equality case of `cor:dpi-rep` = sufficiency |
| `prop:fisher-neyman` | ✓ | factorization theorem; standard-Borel supplies r.c.p. |
| `def:ratedist`, `def:parity` | ✓ | operational vs absolute correctly separated |

### §5 Bounded-learner gap
| Result | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|

| `def:vc`, `def:rademacher`, `thm:uniform` | ✓ | symmetrization + McDiarmid (const `1/n` for `ℓ∈[0,1]`); est. error `4R+O(√…)` (factor 4 = ERM + in-class opt) |
| `prop:capacity-separation` | ✓ | bijective reparam keeps `σ`/info, inflates margin-norm ⟹ Rademacher; sound |
| `def:advantage`, `thm:bounded-gap` | ✓ | proof in appendix; sandwich correct, info channel cancels |
| `cor:realizable-gap`, `cor:size-gap` | ✓ | `Δ(rep',rep)=−Δ(rep,rep')`; union bound `1−2δ` |
| `prop:regime` (i)(ii)(iii) | ✓ | `n≳(4c₀)²·C` threshold; `VC(H∘rep)≤VC(H)` (shattered set maps to shattered set of equal size) verified |

| `ex:r4-defect` + `tab:r4-defect` | ✓ | **all numbers recomputed**, see §4 below |

### §7 Empirical anchoring / §8 Predictions
Strictly retrodiction and falsifiable conjecture (not proved results, by design;
guardrails G1/G2/G6). Checked that every invocation of a theorem matches the
theorem's actual content: T1↔`thm:irrelevance`+`thm:bounded-gap`,
T3↔`cor:realizable-gap`+`prop:regime`(iii), T2↔`prop:regime`(ii). Sign-agnostic
framing (F1 prohibition / F2 trend) is consistent with the one-sided bounds.
The `pred:size` envelope `|Δ| ≤ min{Φ, c·δ_par}+o(‖v̄‖)` correctly combines
`cor:size-gap` and `thm:defect-risk-gap`/`cor:defect-two-term`. ✓

### Appendix proofs
| Proof | Verdict | Key check |
|---|---|---|
| `lem:bayes-functional` | ✓ | `R*(rep)=E[G(q_rep)]`; `G` concave (inf of affines); monotonicity via conditional Jensen (correct direction) |
| `lem:suff-collapse` | ✓ | sufficiency ⟺ `q_rep=q_id` a.s.; tower rule + monotone-class on standard Borel |
| `thm:irrelevance` | ✓ | parity ⟹ both sufficient ⟹ posteriors collapse ⟹ equal `G` integrands ⟹ equal Bayes risk; absolute parity never used |
| `cor:ratedist-gap` | ✓ | (a) log loss `G(p)=H(p)`; (b) TV/Pinsker/Jensen with `E[KL(q_id‖q_rep)]=I(Y;X\|rep(X))=infogap` verified |
| `thm:retraction`, `cor:defect-subadditive` | ✓ | categorical algebra re-derived (see §3 row) |
| `thm:bounded-gap` | ✓ | floor (deterministic) + ceiling (`thm:uniform`) − subtraction; `R*(id)` cancels; no info term |
| `thm:defect-risk-gap` | ✓ (eq. citation corrected, fix 1.4) | KR per instance + Jensen; parity cancels middle gap |
| `prop:defect-fisher-local` | ✓ | bounded-loss/TV + Pinsker + `prop:kl-fisher` at aggregate `v̄`; remainder is 2nd-order Taylor |

## 3. Idealization-disclosure audit (guardrail G3)

G3 requires every invocation of `thm:irrelevance` to disclose the idealization
it rests on via `\idealization{…}`. Disclosures present: §3 ×1
(`thm:retraction`, **added by fix 1.2**), §4 ×4 (`rem:which-parity`,
`rem:parity-ledger`, `rem:slogan`, `rem:ratedist-reading`), §5 ×1
(`thm:bounded-gap`), §6 ×2 (`thm:defect-risk-gap`, `prop:defect-fisher-local`),
§7 ×2 (anchor-T1, anchor-T3), §8 ×1 (`rem:pred-honesty`), §10 ×1, appendix ×6
(proofs of irrelevance, ratedist-gap, retraction, bounded-gap, defect-risk-gap,
fisher-local). **Total 18.**

After fix 1.2 every *section-body theorem* that consumes the at-optimum result
carries a co-located disclosure (statement or adjacent remark) **and** its
appendix proof carries one — consistent across §3/§4/§5/§6. **G3 satisfied.**

Remaining (deliberately not changed): `cor:defect-finer-order` (§6) invokes
`thm:irrelevance` only to restate that the Bayes risk is constant on the parity
class — it introduces no idealization beyond what its inputs
(`thm:defect-risk-gap`, already disclosed) carry, so no separate disclosure is
warranted. `rem:cat-go-scope` (§3) is a scope remark that now sits under the
`thm:retraction` disclosure. Both are covered, not gaps.

## 4. Numerical re-verification (`ex:r4-defect` / `tab:r4-defect`)

Recomputed in Python from the R4 recovery profile (contracts 100%, node kinds
99.8%, parent–child edges 98.7%, types 96.4%, byte-exact 0/30), `v̄ᵢ = 1−rec`,
diagonal Fisher (unit on semantic coords, ≈0 on the inert byte coord), `L=λ=1`:

| Quantity | Paper | Recomputed |
|---|---|---|
| Global term `\overline{W₁} ≲ Σ_rel v̄ᵢ` | 0.051 | 0.0510 |
| Fisher term `√(v̄ᵀFv̄)` | 0.038 | 0.0383 |
| `δ_par = global + λ·Fisher` | 0.089 | 0.0893 |
| naive `‖v̄‖` (unit incl. byte) | ≈1.00 | 1.0007 |
| ratio naive / Fisher | ≈26 | 26.1 |

Fisher-coefficient cross-check (`prop:defect-fisher-local`): `√(½·½)=½=√¼`,
matching `eq:defect-fisher-local`. All consistent.

## 5. Build confirmation

`tectonic main.tex` → `main.pdf` (~390 KiB). No undefined references, no
undefined citations, no `??` literals. Remaining warnings are
overfull/underfull `\hbox` (typesetting), which belong to the Step-2 polish
pass and were intentionally not addressed here.
